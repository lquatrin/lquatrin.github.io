Hi, I'm Leonardo Quatrin Campagnolo!

I am a Researcher and Software Developer at Tecgraf Institute (PUC-Rio). My research primarily relates to visualization, with focus on real-time volume visualization and volumetric illumination. I'm also very interested in Real-time Rendering, Computer Vision, Image Processing, Computer Graphics, and Machine Learning in general.

I completed my Master's degree (2015) and Ph.D. (2021) at PUC-Rio, advised by Professor Waldemar Celes. Also, I obtained a Bachelor's (2012) in Computer Science from UFSM, advised by Professor Cesar Pozzer.
